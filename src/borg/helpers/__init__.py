"""
This package contains all sorts of small helper / utility functionality,
that did not fit better elsewhere.

It used to be in borg/helpers.py but was split into the modules in this
package, which are imported into here for compatibility.
"""

# misc.py is just the moved/renamed old helpers.py for an easy start.
# over time, more and more stuff shall be moved from misc to other modules.
