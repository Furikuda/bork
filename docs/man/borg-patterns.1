.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Exclusion patterns support four separate styles, fnmatch, shell, regular
expressions and path prefixes. By default, fnmatch is used. If followed
by a colon (\(aq:\(aq) the first two characters of a pattern are used as a
style selector. Explicit style selection is necessary when a
non\-default style is desired or when the desired pattern starts with
two alphanumeric characters followed by a colon (i.e. \fIaa:something/*\fP).
.sp
\fI\%Fnmatch\fP, selector \fIfm:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is the default style.  These patterns use a variant of shell
pattern syntax, with \(aq*\(aq matching any number of characters, \(aq?\(aq
matching any single character, \(aq[...]\(aq matching any single
character specified, including ranges, and \(aq[!...]\(aq matching any
character not specified. For the purpose of these patterns, the
path separator (\(aq\(aq for Windows and \(aq/\(aq on other systems) is not
treated specially. Wrap meta\-characters in brackets for a literal
match (i.e. \fI[?]\fP to match the literal character \fI?\fP). For a path
to match a pattern, it must completely match from start to end, or
must match from the start to just before a path separator. Except
for the root path, paths will never end in the path separator when
matching is attempted.  Thus, if a given pattern ends in a path
separator, a \(aq*\(aq is appended before matching is attempted.

.sp
Shell\-style patterns, selector \fIsh:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Like fnmatch patterns these are similar to shell patterns. The difference
is that the pattern may include \fI**/\fP for matching zero or more directory
levels, \fI*\fP for matching zero or more arbitrary characters with the
exception of any path separator.

.sp
Regular expressions, selector \fIre:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Regular expressions similar to those found in Perl are supported. Unlike
shell patterns regular expressions are not required to match the complete
path and any substring match is sufficient. It is strongly recommended to
anchor patterns to the start (\(aq^\(aq), to the end (\(aq$\(aq) or both. Path
separators (\(aq\(aq for Windows and \(aq/\(aq on other systems) in paths are
always normalized to a forward slash (\(aq/\(aq) before applying a pattern. The
regular expression syntax is described in the \fI\%Python documentation for
the re module\fP\&.

.sp
Prefix path, selector \fIpp:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This pattern style is useful to match whole sub\-directories. The pattern
\fIpp:/data/bar\fP matches \fI/data/bar\fP and everything therein.

.sp
Exclusions can be passed via the command line option \fI\-\-exclude\fP\&. When used
from within a shell the patterns should be quoted to protect them from
expansion.
.sp
The \fI\-\-exclude\-from\fP option permits loading exclusion patterns from a text
file with one pattern per line. Lines empty or starting with the number sign
(\(aq#\(aq) after removing whitespace on both ends are ignored. The optional style
selector prefix is also supported for patterns loaded from a file. Due to
whitespace removal paths with whitespace at the beginning or end can only be
excluded using regular expressions.
